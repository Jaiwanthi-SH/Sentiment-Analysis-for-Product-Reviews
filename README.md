# 📊 Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews  
A machine learning project that predicts the sentiment of product reviews (positive/negative) using deep learning techniques.  
This repository contains the complete workflow including data loading, preprocessing, EDA, model building, training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project builds an end-to-end **Sentiment Analysis** system using an RNN-based deep learning model.  
It processes text reviews, learns patterns in customer opinion, and predicts the associated sentiment.

Key components include:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, normalization)
- Sequence padding & embedding
- RNN/LSTM-based sentiment classifier
- Model training, evaluation & visualization
- Deployment-ready notebook
